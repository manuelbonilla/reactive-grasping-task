In order to use either the SoftHand or the instrumented glove all permissions for USB ports must be set. To do that you can type

sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0 

each time you plug these devices.

Another way to do that is to add your user to one of the groups allowed by the USB ports

ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0

sudo adduser username groupname


restart
